    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Marcelo Viana and I am from Brazil. I like studying and my
        hobbies are going for a walk in the park, riding bikes and enjoying spending time with
        my husband and our dog. I also enjoy learning languages, reading, watching movies and
        series, and studying.
    \n\nI\'ve been learning how to develop apps for Android. It\'s been so much fun! I want to make
        a huge positive impact in the world, and that will be like a domino effect or a butterfly
        effect. There are a lot of women, Afro-descendant and LGBTQI+ people who could be making a
        difference, but unfortunately, many of them can\'t because they won\'t have the opportunity
        to do so. How many more scientists, physicians, teacher, professors, grandmothers and
        grandfathers won\'t exist?
    \n\nSo, would you like to impact the world positively as well? Send me a message! Let\'s
    exchange ideas and bring opportunities to as many human beings as we can!\n\n</string>
